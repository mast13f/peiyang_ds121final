DS121 Final Project

### Introduction
Overwatch is a PvP (players vs. players) first-person shooter game released by Blizzard Entertainment in 2016, which had gained a large number of players worldwide in a short period of time, and it is still one of the most popular computer games now. Unlike traditional first-person shooter (FPS) games like Counter-Strike series, Overwatch is very team-based, which means that it requires players not only to have a good aiming skill, but also to have sufficient strategy, decision-making skills, and team awareness. A complete team contains five players playing three different roles: tanks, damages, and supports. Players need to use their different abilities, and only by working together, with each roles doing thier own job, can they have the best chance of winning. On the contrary, unexpected death caused by separation from the team will often bring disadvantage to the whole team. However, nothing is absolute, and sometimes early kills from individual heroism in the game can give the team a numerical advantage. Therefore, there is a topic that has been discussed by Overwatch players all the time: is teamwork or individual performance more important? This project will try to answer this question from a data science perspective.
